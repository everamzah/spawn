## Re-hosting

This mod is being re-hosted by taikedz ; everamzah voluntarily provided a data dump in 2016 when he left the community, without specifying the license. The authorship then can be attributed to him; the license is to be presumed LGPLv2.1, as this seems to be what he tended to release fully original code under.
